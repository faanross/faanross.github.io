<p>Threat hunting is not typically viewed as an &ldquo;entry-level&rdquo; cybersecurity discipline, probably because it is a layer of abstraction woven from other, more <em>fundamental</em>, layers of abstraction. It is not a house built from bricks, but a neighborhood built from houses.</p>
<p>I have however created this course <code>specifically with the beginner in mind</code>. What that practically entails is that I do my best to not indulge in pedantry while providing sufficient  information that allows you to follow along not only with what we are doing, but crucially, <em><strong>why we are doing it</strong></em>.</p>
<figure class="custom-figure-8"><img src="/img/gif/karpathy.png"/>

<p>I am a huge believer in this approach to learning outlined above by the wonderful <a href="https://twitter.com/karpathy">Andrej Karpathy</a>. This course is built on this approach - instead of mastering every single foundational discipline that converge as threat hunting, we will be learning on-demand. That&rsquo;s to say we&rsquo;ll start with the final application, and then work our way back to understand how it connects to its foundational knowledge. This way the fat is trimmed - we&rsquo;ll learn what we need, when we need, to understand why we&rsquo;re doing what we&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>All this to say - <code>if you are beginner and you are curious about threat hunting then you are in the right place</code>. I can promise that if you venture along, by the end of our journey many so-called &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; topics will appear in a whole new light. Since one only truly begins a journey of understanding when going from the <em>idea phase</em> to the <em>experience phase</em>, we might as well start there.</p>

<p>Finally I do want to add that I myself am an <code>eternal student</code> and always learning. As this course (hopefully) may play some role in your journey of understanding, so of course it has played such a role in my own. As such it&rsquo;s <em>highly</em> likely I will make mistakes.</p>
<p>Mistakes themselves of course represent the potential for further understanding - but only if we become aware of them. So if there&rsquo;s anything here you are unsure about, or simply flat-out disagree with <em><strong>please</strong></em> feel free to reach out and share this with me so that everyone can potentially benefit. You can connect with me on <a href="https://twitter.com/faanross">Twitter</a>, or feel free to <a href="mailto:moi@faanross.com">email me</a>.</p>
