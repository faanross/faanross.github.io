      <description>this site contains original content related to threat hunting, active defense, and deception.

      <description>PREFACE This is a short article covering a single foundational concept related to threat hunting. I&amp;rsquo;m publishing it here as a stand-alone post because I would like to reference it in some of my courses without needing to reproduce it in every such instance. Nevertheless, I hope, even here by itself, it might provide some value to you.
