Threat hunting is not typically viewed as an &amp;ldquo;entry-level&amp;rdquo; cybersecurity discipline, probably because it is a layer of abstraction woven from other, more fundamental, layers of abstraction. It is not a house built from bricks, but a neighborhood built from houses.
I have however created this course specifically with the beginner in mind. What that practically entails is that I do my best to not indulge in pedantry while providing sufficient foundational information so that you can follow along not only with what we are doing, but crucially, why we are doing it.</description>

1.1. Introduction In this section we&amp;rsquo;ll set up the three VMs we&amp;rsquo;ll need for the course - Windows 10 (Victim), Kali Linux (Attacker), and Ubuntu 20.04 (Post-Mortem Analysis). First we&amp;rsquo;ll download the iso images and use them to install the operating systems. Then, depending on the specific VM, we&amp;rsquo;ll perform some configurations as well as install extra software.
1.2. Requirements I do want to give you some sense of the hardware requirements for this course, however I also have to add that I am not an expert in this area.</description>

2. Performing the Attack 2.1. Introduction Why are we performing the attack ourselves? Why didn&amp;rsquo;t I just do it, export all the requisite artifacts, and share this with you? Why am I making you go through this rigmarole - is it simply that I am cruel?
Nah. The reason is pretty simple - I have a deep sense of conviction that one can only truly &amp;ldquo;get&amp;rdquo; defense if you equally &amp;ldquo;get&amp;rdquo; offense.</description>

3. Live Analysis: Native Windows Tools 3.1. Introduction So our first analysis will be a quick review using standard (native) Windows tools. These tools are a quick way to get a finger on the pulse - they&amp;rsquo;ll give us a broad overview of some important indicators while at the same time being limited in the depth of information.
So if we have at our disposal better tools, ie tools that can provide more information, why bother?</description>

4. Live Analysis: Process Hacker 4.1. Introduction I explained, hopefully in a somewhat convincing manner, why it&amp;rsquo;s good practice for us to learn how to use the native Windows tools to get an initial, high-level read. But of course these tools are also limited in what information they can provide.
So now let&amp;rsquo;s bring out the big guns and learn all we can.</description>

5. Post-Mortem Forensics: Memory 5.1. Transferring the Artifacts First thing&amp;rsquo;s first - we need to transfer the artifacts we produced in 2.3.6 over to our Ubuntu analyst VM.
But just as a note: we&amp;rsquo;ll only transfer our memory dump and packet capture. We won&amp;rsquo;t transfer our log files - I&amp;rsquo;ll explain exactly why later.
Ok so there are a number of ways we can transfer our files over, and if you have your own method you prefer please go ahead.</description>

6. Post-Mortem Forensics: Log Analysis 6.1. Introduction Now typically we might think of logging as belonging more to the realm of the SOC than a threat hunter. That&amp;rsquo;s because, at least in the way that modern logging practices operate, logging is not seen as something directly approachable by a human operator.
What do I mean by this? One consequence of the &amp;ldquo;endpoint arm&amp;rsquo;s race&amp;rdquo; that vendors have taken the industry on is the unimaginable scale of the data being generated.</description>

7.1. Introduction In many respects, the realm of network packets is the ultimate domain for threat hunting. It is the only place where malware cannot hide, especially if it intends to communicate. Thus, even if malicious traffic is buried under an avalanche of legitimate traffic, one thing is for sure: the malware&amp;rsquo;s communication is always present, somewhere.
Traffic analysis is an absolutely integral part of threat hunting, playing a major role in nearly every aspectâ€”whether you are searching for initial evidence or seeking to build a case.</description>

      <description>Hello friend, so glad you could make it. This is the first in an ongoing + always-evolving series on threat hunting.
The main thing I want you to know about this course is that we will learn by doing.
| Set up | We&amp;rsquo;ll start off by creating + configuring our own virtual network, including VMs for the victim, attacker, and analyst.
| Attack | Then, instead of using prepackaged data we&amp;rsquo;ll generate data by performing the attack ourselves.</description>

      <description>this site contains original content related to threat hunting, active defense, and deception.
but since you clicked on about i&amp;rsquo;m gonna assume you also want to learn a bit about me, faan ross.
first off, this is not me. this is nathan fielder, but i really like him and really like this gif - so why not start there?
further, since we find ourselves here it should come as no great shock that I love all things cybersecurity.</description>

      <title>The 3 Modes of Threat Hunting</title>
      <link>https://athul.github.io/archie/posts/three_modes/</link>

      <description>PREFACE This is a short article covering a single foundational concept related to threat hunting. I&amp;rsquo;m publishing it here as a stand-alone post because I would like to reference it in some of my courses without needing to reproduce it in every such instance. Nevertheless, I hope, even here by itself, it might provide some value to you.
INTRODUCTION Threat hunting, by its literal definition, is predicated on a single presumption: we presume a compromise has already occurred, and thus an adversary is established on our network.</description>
