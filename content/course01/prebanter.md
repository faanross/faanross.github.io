Threat hunting is not typically viewed as an "entry-level" cybersecurity discipline, probably because it is a layer of abstraction woven from other, more *fundamental*, layers of abstraction. It is not a house built from bricks, but a neighborhood built from houses. 

I have however created this course `specifically with the beginner in mind`. What that practically entails is that I do my best to not indulge in pedantry while providing sufficient  information that allows you to follow along not only with what we are doing, but crucially, ***why we are doing it***.

I am a huge believer in this approach to learning outlined above by the wonderful [Andrej Karpathy](https://twitter.com/karpathy). This course is built on this approach - instead of mastering every single foundational discipline that converge as threat hunting, we will be learning on-demand. That's to say we'll start with the final application, and then work our way back to understand how it connects to its foundational knowledge. This way the fat is trimmed - we'll learn what we need, when we need, to understand why we're doing what we're doing. 

All this to say - `if you are beginner and you are curious about threat hunting then you are in the right place`. I can promise that if you venture along, by the end of our journey many so-called "advanced" topics will appear in a whole new light. Since one only truly begins a journey of understanding when going from the *idea phase* to the *experience phase*, we might as well start there.

Finally I do want to add that I myself am an `eternal student` and always learning. As this course (hopefully) may play some role in your journey of understanding, so of course it has played such a role in my own. As such it's *highly* likely I will make mistakes. 

Mistakes themselves of course represent the potential for further understanding - but only if we become aware of them. So if there's anything here you are unsure about, or simply flat-out disagree with ***please*** feel free to reach out and share this with me so that everyone can potentially benefit. You can connect with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/faanross), or feel free to [email me](mailto:moi@faanross.com).
