## Introduction

First publicly disclosed in 2014 by security firms Symantec and Kaspersky Lab, Regin is a multi-stage cyber-attack platform engineered for long-term, stealthy intelligence-gathering operations. Regin's architecture is defined by several key characteristics that underscore its focus on stealth and operational flexibility. It employs a **complex, multi-stage loading process** where each component, with the exception of the initial dropper, is **encrypted and hidden**, revealing little about the overall framework if discovered in isolation.

This modularity is a core feature, allowing its operators to deploy custom payloads tailored to specific targets. These payloads range from standard remote access trojans to specialized modules designed to monitor and control critical telecommunications infrastructure.

The C2 infrastructure utilizes multiple protocols including **ICMP, HTTP/S, and custom TCP/UDP streams**. Most notably, it establishes a **peer-to-peer network of "communication drones"** within a compromised environment, drastically minimizing detectable outbound traffic and allowing the operators to bridge air-gapped networks.

Perhaps its most unusual capability is its functionality for targeting Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) networks. Regin possesses modules capable of compromising and controlling Base Station Controllers (BSCs), giving its operators the power to monitor and manipulate cellular communications.

This report provides a detailed technical dissection of the Regin platform, its architecture, network operations, payload capabilities, and the evidence supporting its attribution.
