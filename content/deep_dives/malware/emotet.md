## Introduction

## Introduction

Emotet, first identified in 2014, has evolved significantly from its origins as a banking trojan into a premier Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) infrastructure. Its primary function in the modern cybercrime ecosystem is to serve as a distribution network, providing initial access for other secondary payloads, including other banking trojans like TrickBot and Qakbot, and other precursors to ransomware attacks.

This report provides an exhaustive, network-centric analysis of the Emotet malware. The focus is exclusively on its "on-the-wire" characteristics: its command-and-control (C2) architecture, its communication protocols, and the network behaviours of its key modules. Endpoint artifacts and host-based indicators are deliberately omitted to serve the specific needs of network defenders, threat hunters, and intelligence analysts who are tasked with detecting and mitigating this threat at the network level.

The history of Emotet is marked by continuous evolution and a significant law enforcement takedown in January 2021, which serves as a critical demarcation point for analysis. This event, dubbed "Operation Ladybird," provided a temporary reprieve, but the botnet's re-emergence in late 2021 underscored the resilience of its design and the persistence of its operators.

Understanding Emotet's network behaviour and design is not just about detecting a single malware family, it's about identifying the initial stage of a potentially catastrophic intrusion.
