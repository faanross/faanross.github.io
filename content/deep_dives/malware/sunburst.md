## Introduction
The [SUNBURST](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.sunburst) incident represents a watershed moment in the history of supply-chain attacks.
Executed by a highly sophisticated threat actor - variously tracked as [APT29](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0016/), UNC2452, NOBELIUM, or StellarParticle - 
the campaign demonstrated an unparalleled level of patience, operational security (OPSEC), and technical tradecraft. 

This guide provides a technical deconstruction of the SUNBURST C2 protocol, intended not as a historical recounting 
but as a granular analysis for red team practitioners. The primary focus is on the C2 lifecycle, from its initial 
anti-analysis checks and DNS-based state management to its interactive HTTP communications and second-stage payload delivery. 
The protocol's design reveals a strategic prioritization of stealth and infrastructure longevity over speed, 
offering amazing insights into the development of resilient and low-observability offensive tooling.
