## Malware of the Day
I write a monthly report for [Active Countermeasures](activecountermeasures.com) called [Malware of the Day](https://www.activecountermeasures.com/category/malware-of-the-day/), where I simulate an intrusion and
subsequent network threat hunt. All **pcap + zeek logs are also provided**, allowing you to get hands-on experience by emulating the investigation
at home.
