## Preface
Please note you don't need a special VM for this course since we'll be developing. So I recommend using your base OS ("daily driver")
since that way you can just use this setup to continue your coding efforts following this course. If however you wanted to keep
things "seperated", you could def do it on a VM, it won't hurt, but since that's not required I'm not going to provide instructions.

There are essentially 4 things you need: go, an IDA, the course repo, and "extra apps". I will provide instructions on setting
these up for all three OS - Windows, Darwin, and Linux. Note I am using Darwin, just my preference, but there should be no reason
you could not follow along using any OS.
