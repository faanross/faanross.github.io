## Solutions
All the final solutions are available on GitHub [here](https://www.github.com/faanross/workshop_antisyphon_25042025).

## Overview
Below are the lecture notes for my AntiSyphon workshop presented on April 25th 2025. Though the notes are in 
general more descriptive than the actual lectures, they are not expanded, meaning the content from the lectures roughly map
1:1 onto these notes. This means some shortcuts were taken as I had to ensure the entire course could fit into the 
allotted 4 hours.

If you'd like to do the same course that goes into greater depth, has explanatory lectures reviewing essential
theory prior to the practical labs, and has multiple bonus labs please see the Director's Cut [here]({{< ref "../workshop_dcut/moc.md" >}}).

That version is much more complete, rounded, and a better overall educational experience imo,
**so if you are not here from the workshop, but would like to learn, I HIGHLY encourage you to follow the Director's Cut curriculum instead.**
