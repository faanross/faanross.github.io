## Overview
Below are the lecture notes for my AntiSyphon workshop presented on April 25th 2025. Though the notes are in 
general more descriptive than the actual lectures, they are not expanded, meaning the content from the lectures roughly map
1:1 onto these notes. This means some shortcuts were taken as I had to ensure the entire course could fit into the 
allotted 4 hours.

**If you'd like to do this same essential course but go into greater depth, please see the Director's Cut** [here]({{< ref "../workshop_dcut/moc.md" >}}).
There I have included numerous explanatory lectures reviewing essential theory prior to the practical labs, and 
it has multiple bonus labs which will build out more essential components. It roughly has twice the amount of content,
and is imo a much more complete, rounded, and better overall educational experience.
