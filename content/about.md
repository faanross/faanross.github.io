I'm a security researcher at [Active Countermeasures](https://www.activecountermeasures.com) that ponders one specific question: **how to detect C2 frameworks && malware network communication more broadly.**

In the quest to become hopefully somewhat competent at this I like approaching the challenge from both sides.

Donning my defensive hat I think about ways to tease out C2 communication by taking a **statistical + fingerprinting approach**. 

And to better understand exactly **how C2 communicates**, or even better, how it **_could_ still potentially communicate**, 
I love developing C2 emulation tools, almost exclusively in **Go**.

I also teach a number of workshops and courses about **C2 development in Golang** with [AntiSyphon](https://www.antisyphontraining.com), you can find info on these [here](https://www.antisyphontraining.com/instructor/faan-ross/). 

On this site you can find a variety of content that, in some way or another, relate
to the **development + analysis of malware network communication profiles**, with an overall emphasis on C2/RATs.


If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to connect with me - moi@faanross.com.

**Live long and prosper**.
