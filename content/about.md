I'm a security researcher at [Active Countermeasures](https://www.activecountermeasures.com) interested in **post-exploitation malware development**,
**covert channels**, **offensive sec tooling**, **ai (for) red teaming** etc.

I teach a number of workshops and courses about C2 development in Golang with AntiSyphon, you can find info on these [here](https://www.antisyphontraining.com/instructor/faan-ross/).

If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to [connect](mailto:moi@faanross.com).

**Live long and prosper**.
