I'm a security researcher at Active Countermeasures that ponders one specific question: **how to detect C2 frameworks**.

While most tackle this problem by looking at the endpoint, my interest lies in taking a **network threat hunting approach**.

Why? Because all applications stand naked before the Network Gods. That's my pretentious way of saying that **on the network, 
there's nowhere to hide**. 
The issue isn't whether it's there, but rather how to find it buried inside the chaotic deluge of legitimate traffic.

In the quest to become hopefully somewhat competent at this I like approaching the challenge from both sides.

Donning my defensive hat I think about ways to tease out C2 communication by taking a **statistical + fingerprinting approach**. 
Though the specifics differ depending on the exact question I'm asking, the common thread almost always involves the use of **Zeek + Python**.

And to better understand exactly **how C2 communicates**, as well as how it **could still potentially communicate**, 
I develop C2 emulation tools, mostly in **Go**.

On this site you can find a variety of **courses**, **guides**, **projects**, and **articles** that all, in some way or another, **intersect with what I've described above**.
