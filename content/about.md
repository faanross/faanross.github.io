I'm a security researcher at [Active Countermeasures](https://www.activecountermeasures.com) specializing in **post-exploitation 
malware development** and **network-centric threat hunting**. While these disciplines may appear divergent, I see them as two sides of 
the same coin - cultivating competence in one deepens insight into the other.

I also teach a number of workshops and courses about **C2 development in Golang** with AntiSyphon, you can find info on these [here](https://www.antisyphontraining.com/instructor/faan-ross/).

If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to [connect](mailto:moi@faanross.com).

**Live long and prosper**.

Faan
