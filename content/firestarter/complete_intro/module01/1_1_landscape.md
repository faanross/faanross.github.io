### **Red Team vs Penetration Testing Tooling**

The tools you build depend on your mission. Red team and penetration testing operations have fundamentally different requirements:

#### Penetration Testing Tools
##### CHARACTERISTICS
- Time-boxed engagements (1-4 weeks typically)
- Goal: Find as many vulnerabilities as possible
- Detection is acceptable (client knows you're testing)
- Speed and coverage matter more than stealth (in general, not always true)
- Comprehensive reporting required
- Breadth over depth

##### TOOL REQUIREMENTS
- Fast scanning and enumeration
- Wide vulnerability coverage
- Automated exploitation when possible
- Clear, detailed logging for reports
- Multiple protocol support
- Integration with reporting tools



#### Red Team Tools
##### CHARACTERISTICS
- Long-duration operations (weeks to months)
- Goal: Achieve specific objectives (data access, persistence)
- Must remain undetected (simulating real adversaries)
- Stealth and operational security critical
- Mimics APT tactics, techniques, and procedures
- Depth over breadth

##### TOOL REQUIREMENTS
- Low detection profile (AV/EDR evasion)
- Operational security features (encrypted C2, fail-safes)
- Long-term persistence mechanisms
- Flexible, modular capabilities
- Realistic adversary simulation
- Minimal forensic footprint


#### Comparison Matrix

| Aspect             | Penetration Testing         | Red Teaming         |
| ------------------ | --------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Duration**       | Days to weeks               | Weeks to months     |
| **Detection**      | Acceptable                  | Must avoid          |
| **Scope**          | Defined targets             | Entire organization |
| **Approach**       | Systematic, comprehensive   | Targeted, stealthy  |
| **Tools**          | Off-the-shelf, automated    | Custom, manual      |
| **Success Metric** | Vulnerabilities found       | Objectives achieved |
| **Reporting**      | Detailed technical findings | Strategic insights  |

#### Why This Matters for Tool Development

When you build a tool, you must ask: _"Is this for pentesting or red teaming?"_

- **Pentesting tool**: Optimize for speed, coverage, reporting.
- **Red team tool**: Optimize for stealth, OpSec, flexibility. Detection = failure.

This course focuses on **red team tooling**, which is in general technically harder and teaches more foundational concepts.

```

**Why Companies Pay for Commercial Tools:**

1. **Support and Liability**: Vendor support, SLAs, legal protection
2. **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides, training materials
3. **Compliance**: Meeting audit requirements, certifications
4. **Team Coordination**: Multi-operator features, reporting
5. **Time Savings**: Pre-built capabilities vs custom development
6. **Legal Safety**: Licensed, authorized use

**The Reality Check:**

Despite high prices, commercial tools have significant limitations:

- **Heavily Signatured**: Widely known, easily detected
- **Generic**: Not tailored to specific targets
- **Licensing Restrictions**: Per-user costs, audit trails
- **Limited Customization**: Closed-source, proprietary
- **Leaked/Cracked**: Cobalt Strike cracks widely available

This creates opportunities for custom tool development.


### **The Open-Source Ecosystem**

Open-source offensive tools have democratized security testing but come with trade-offs:

**Major Open-Source Frameworks:**

```
METASPLOIT FRAMEWORK (Ruby)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
• The standard: 2000+ exploits, 500+ payloads
• Modular architecture: exploits, payloads, auxiliary, post
• Meterpreter: Feature-rich post-exploitation payload
• Extensive community, constant updates
• Downsides: Well-signatured, noisy, AV/EDR catches easily

EMPIRE (PowerShell/Python) [Deprecated, but BC Security fork]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
• PowerShell-based post-exploitation framework
• Pure in-memory operation, no disk artifacts
• Extensive modules, lateral movement capabilities
• Downsides: AMSI/ETW can detect, signatures exist

SLIVER (Go) 
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
• Modern C2 written in Go 
• Cross-platform implants, multiple C2 protocols
• Active development, good evasion out-of-box
• Multiplayer support, extensible
• Excellent reference for learning Go offensive development

MYTHIC (Multi-language)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
• Agent-agnostic C2 framework
• Supports multiple payload types (Python, C#, Go)
• Web UI, Docker-based deployment
• Collaborative red teaming features
```

**Open-Source Advantages:**

✓ **Free**: No licensing costs  
✓ **Customizable**: Modify source code  
✓ **Learning**: Study implementation details  
✓ **Community**: Shared knowledge, modules  
✓ **Transparent**: Know exactly what it does

**Open-Source Disadvantages:**

✗ **Well-Known**: Defenders study the same tools  
✗ **Signatured**: AV/EDR vendors focus on popular tools  
✗ **No Support**: Community-driven, best-effort  
✗ **Operational Security**: Public code = public TTPs


### **The Custom Tools Approach**

This is where **you** come in. The most effective red teams build custom tooling:

**Why Custom Tools Win:**

```
1. UNIQUE SIGNATURES
   Commercial/OSS tools → Known to defenders
   Custom tools → Zero prior exposure

2. TAILORED TO TARGET
   Generic tools → One-size-fits-all approach
   Custom tools → Designed for specific environment

3. OPERATIONAL SECURITY
   Public tools → TTPs known, countermeasures exist
   Custom tools → Defenders don't know what to look for

4. FLEXIBILITY
   Fixed tools → Limited to built-in capabilities
   Custom tools → Build exactly what you need

5. LEARNING
   Using tools → Understand WHAT they do
   Building tools → Understand HOW and WHY
```

**The Economics of Custom Development:**

|Aspect|Commercial Tools|Custom Development|
|---|---|---|
|**Initial Cost**|High ($5k-50k/year)|Developer time|
|**Per-Engagement Cost**|Recurring licensing|One-time development|
|**Detection Risk**|High (known tools)|Low (unique code)|
|**Flexibility**|Limited|Unlimited|
|**Long-term Value**|Ongoing payments|One-time investment|

**Career Insight:**

Organizations increasingly value developers who can build custom tools over operators who only use existing ones. This skill differentiates you in the job market.

### **Technology Shifts That Changed Everything**

Several technological shifts fundamentally changed offensive tooling:

**1. Shift to In-Memory Execution (2007)**

```
BEFORE: Disk-based payloads
• Write executable to disk → Run it → Get caught by AV

AFTER: In-memory injection
• Metasploit's Meterpreter: DLL injected into memory
• No disk artifacts, harder to detect
• Spawned entire category of "fileless" malware

Impact on Tool Development:
→ Process injection became core skill
→ Shellcode loaders essential
→ Reflective DLL injection standard technique
```

**2. PowerShell Revolution (2013-2017)**

```
INSIGHT: Windows includes a powerful scripting engine

Advantages:
• Pre-installed on all modern Windows
• Can access .NET framework
• Runs in memory natively
• Signed by Microsoft (trusted)

Tools Enabled:
• Empire, Nishang, PowerSploit, Invoke-Mimikatz

Impact on Tool Development:
→ "Living off the land" became viable strategy
→ Defenders responded with AMSI, CLR ETW
→ Led to obfuscation arms race
```

**3. Defender Technology Arms Race (2018-Present)**

```
DEFENSIVE IMPROVEMENTS:
• Windows Defender ATP → Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
• EDR solutions everywhere (CrowdStrike, SentinelOne, etc.)
• AMSI (Anti-Malware Scan Interface)
• ETW (Event Tracing for Windows)
• Kernel callbacks and telemetry

OFFENSIVE RESPONSES:
• Direct syscalls (bypass userland hooks)
• Unhooking techniques
• AMSI bypasses
• PPL (Protected Process Light) abuse
• BYOVD (vulnerable driver exploitation)

Current State:
→ Cat-and-mouse game continues
→ Evasion techniques get more sophisticated
→ Custom tooling more valuable than ever
```


### **What We've Learned from 25 Years**

The evolution teaches us principles that guide modern tool development:

1. **Modularity Wins**: Metasploit's architecture still influences design today
2. **Evasion is Paramount**: Detection = mission failure for red teams
3. **Native is Better**: LOLBins (Living Off the Land Binaries) evade better
4. **Memory Over Disk**: Fileless techniques are standard now
5. **Encrypted C2**: Unencrypted command and control is unacceptable
6. **Operational Security**: Tool design must consider OpSec from day one
7. **Customization Required**: Off-the-shelf tools get caught

These principles inform every module of this course.

**What Requires Authorization:**

```
LEGAL (With Proper Authorization):
✓ Penetration testing with written contract
✓ Red team engagement with signed RoE (Rules of Engagement)
✓ Security research on your own systems
✓ Bug bounty programs (following their rules)
✓ Academic research in controlled environments
✓ Tool development and testing on your own infrastructure

ILLEGAL (Without Authorization):
✗ "Testing" production systems without permission
✗ Using company tools on external targets
✗ Accessing competitors' systems
✗ Unauthorized vulnerability research on live systems
✗ Sharing or selling exploits for malicious systems
✗ Creating malware for distribution
```

### **The Authorization Documentation**

**Never perform offensive security work without proper documentation.**

**Minimum Required Documentation:**

1. **Statement of Work (SOW)** or Contract

    - Defines scope, objectives, timeline
    - Specifies what's in/out of scope
    - Signed by authorized representative
2. **Rules of Engagement (RoE)**

    - Technical details: IP ranges, systems, techniques
    - Prohibited actions and boundaries
    - Escalation procedures
    - Signed by client and red team
3. **Get-Out-of-Jail-Free Letter**

    - Authorization letter on company letterhead
    - Carry during engagements
    - Includes emergency contact information
    - Notarized in some jurisdictions

**Example Authorization Letter (Simplified):**

```
[Company Letterhead]

AUTHORIZATION FOR SECURITY TESTING

Date: [Date]

To Whom It May Concern:

This letter serves to authorize [Your Company/Team] to perform security testing
activities against [Client Company] infrastructure from [Start Date] through [End Date].

Authorized activities include:
• Network reconnaissance and scanning
• Vulnerability exploitation
• Post-exploitation activities
• Social engineering (as defined in RoE)

Authorized IP ranges:
• 192.168.0.0/16 (internal network)
• 203.0.113.0/24 (external DMZ)

Emergency Contact:
[Name], [Title]
Phone: [Number]
Email: [Email]

Authorized by:
[Signature]
[Name], [Title - must have authority to authorize]
[Company Name]
```

**Legal Horror Stories (Real Cases):**

1. **Case: David Nosal (2012)**

    - Former employee accessed company database using colleague's credentials
    - Convicted under CFAA despite arguably having "permission"
    - Lesson: Authorization must be explicit and documented
2. **Case: weev/Andrew Auernheimer (2013)**

    - Found AT&T iPad user data via URL manipulation
    - Convicted of violating CFAA (later overturned on venue grounds)
    - Lesson: "It was accessible" ≠ "I was authorized"
3. **Case: Marcus Hutchins (2017)**

    - Security researcher who stopped WannaCry ransomware
    - Arrested for creating banking malware years earlier
    - Lesson: Past unauthorized activity can catch up with you

### **Ethical Principles**

Beyond legal compliance, ethical principles guide responsible security work:

**The Ethical Framework:**

```
1. DO NO HARM
   • Minimize disruption to business operations
   • Protect data confidentiality
   • Don't delete or corrupt data
   • Consider impact on end users

2. RESPECT PRIVACY
   • Don't access personal information unnecessarily
   • Don't exfiltrate sensitive data beyond scope
   • Protect any data you do access
   • Follow data handling protocols

3. RESPONSIBLE DISCLOSURE
   • Report vulnerabilities to affected parties
   • Allow reasonable time for patches
   • Don't publicly disclose without coordination
   • Follow disclosure programs/policies

4. PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT
   • Maintain client confidentiality
   • Accurate reporting (no exaggeration or hiding findings)
   • Clear communication about risks
   • Respect engagement boundaries

5. KNOWLEDGE SHARING (Appropriately)
   • Contribute to security community
   • Share defensive knowledge
   • Don't share exploits for vulnerable production systems
   • Consider impact of public disclosure
```

**Gray Areas to Consider:**

```
SCENARIO 1: Found critical vulnerability outside scope
WRONG: Exploit it anyway to demonstrate impact
RIGHT: Document discovery, notify client, get authorization to test

SCENARIO 2: Discovered competitor's data during engagement
WRONG: Examine or exfiltrate it
RIGHT: Notify client immediately, don't access further

SCENARIO 3: Client's systems are severely compromised by real attackers
WRONG: Clean it up without asking
RIGHT: Report immediately, document evidence, get authorization for remediation

SCENARIO 4: Tool you developed is being used for crime
WRONG: Ignore it
RIGHT: Consider responsible disclosure, law enforcement notification if appropriate
```

### **International Considerations**

Laws vary significantly by jurisdiction:

```
UNITED STATES
• CFAA (federal), state laws
• Generally requires explicit authorization
• Bug bounties provide legal safe harbor

EUROPEAN UNION
• Computer Misuse Act (UK) and equivalents
• GDPR implications for data handling
• Generally stricter than US

AUSTRALIA
• Cybercrime Act 2001
• Similar to US framework
• Explicit authorization required

CONSIDERATIONS FOR INTERNATIONAL WORK:
• Client in Country A, targets in Country B, you in Country C
• Which jurisdiction's laws apply?
• Authorization must account for all jurisdictions
• Some countries prohibit security research entirely
• Data sovereignty laws affect exfiltration testing
```

### **Tool Development Liability**

**Can you be held liable for how others use your tools?**

This is a complex question with no simple answer:

**Factors Courts Consider:**

1. **Intent**: Did you design the tool for malicious use?
2. **Legitimate Use**: Does the tool have substantial non-infringing uses?
3. **Marketing**: How do you describe and promote the tool?
4. **Access Controls**: Do you restrict who can obtain it?
5. **Knowledge**: Did you know it was being used illegally?

**Safer Approaches:**

✓ Release for **educational and authorized testing only**  
✓ Include **clear disclaimers and terms of use**  
✓ **Don't include illegal functionality** (e.g., pre-cracked software)  
✓ **Open-source** with permissive license (community scrutiny)  
✓ **Documentation emphasizes legal use**  
✓ **Require authentication** or restrict distribution

**Riskier Approaches:**

✗ Market as "undetectable hacking tool"  
✗ Include exploits for unpatched vulnerabilities  
✗ Sell to anyone without verification  
✗ Ignore reports of illegal use  
✗ Design specifically to evade law enforcement

**This Course's Position:**

The tools you build in this course are powerful. They have legitimate uses in authorized security testing. They can also be misused. We teach you to build them for these reasons:

1. **Defense Requires Understanding Offense**: Blue teamers need to know attacker tools
2. **Authorized Testing Needs Tools**: Legal red teaming requires effective tooling
3. **Education**: Understanding how offensive tools work improves security overall
4. **Career Skills**: These are valuable, legal career skills

**But you must use them responsibly. With great power comes great responsibility.**

## **PART 6: INDUSTRY TRENDS AND EMERGING TECHNIQUES**

### **Current State of the Art (2025)**

The offensive security landscape is evolving rapidly. Understanding current trends helps you build relevant, future-proof skills:

**Trend 1: EDR Evasion is the New Normal**

```
THE SHIFT:
2010-2015: Evading antivirus = basic obfuscation
2015-2020: AV → EDR, techniques got more complex
2020-2025: EDR everywhere, evasion is core skill

CURRENT TECHNIQUES:
• Direct syscalls (bypass userland hooks)
• Unhooking ntdll.dll
• BYOVD (Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver)
• Process injection without suspicious API calls
• Sleeping techniques (Ekko, Zilean)
• Hardware breakpoints for execution

MODULES COVERING THIS:
• Module 2: Direct/Indirect Syscalls
• Module 6: Evasion & Obfuscation
• Module 13: Packing, Crypting, and Protection
```

**Trend 2: Living Off the Land (LOLBins) 2.0**

```
EVOLUTION:
Phase 1: PowerShell, WMI, native Windows tools
Phase 2: Defenders got wise, added telemetry (AMSI, ETW)
Phase 3: Now using lesser-known LOLBins and creative abuse

EXAMPLES:
• MSBuild.exe for code execution
• InstallUtil.exe for persistence
• RegAsm.exe / RegSvcs.exe for execution
• BITSAdmin for file transfer
• Dllhost.exe COM hijacking

WHY IT MATTERS:
• Signed by Microsoft = trusted
• Already on system = no IOC from download
• Defenders slower to detect creative abuse

THIS COURSE:
• Module 7: Persistence Mechanisms
• Module 9: Hooking & Interception (COM abuse)
```

**Trend 3: Supply Chain and Initial Access Focus**

```
OBSERVATION:
• Post-exploitation tools are mature
• Initial access is the hard part now
• Supply chain attacks increasing

TECHNIQUES:
• DLL sideloading with legitimate software
• Package manager poisoning (PyPI, npm, NuGet)
• Trusted process abuse
• Code signing certificate theft/abuse
• Installer manipulation

RELEVANCE:
While this course focuses on post-exploitation, understanding
initial access helps you design better overall operations.
```

**Trend 4: Cloud and Container Post-Exploitation**

```
NEW TARGETS:
• Kubernetes clusters
• Docker containers
• AWS/Azure/GCP environments
• Serverless functions

TECHNIQUES:
• Container escape
• Cloud credential theft (IMDS abuse)
• Kubernetes API abuse
• Lambda/Function persistence
• Cloud storage enumeration

FUTURE MODULE POTENTIAL:
This course focuses on Windows, but Go's cross-platform
nature means techniques transfer to Linux containers.
```

**Trend 5: AI/ML in Offensive Security**

```
CURRENT APPLICATIONS:
• Large language models for social engineering
• Automated vulnerability discovery
• Evasion technique generation
• Phishing content generation
• Log/detection evasion

EXAMPLE:
Using LLMs to generate polymorphic code variants that
bypass static signatures while maintaining functionality.

CAUTION:
AI is a tool, not a replacement for understanding fundamentals.
This course teaches you the fundamentals first.
```

### **What's Coming Next (2025-2030 Predictions)**

Based on current trajectories:

**1. Kernel-Mode Operations Will Become Standard**

```
WHY:
• Userland heavily monitored (EDR hooks everywhere)
• Kernel callbacks detect userland evasion
• PPL (Protected Process Light) blocking userland attacks

TECHNIQUES:
• BYOVD will evolve
• Direct kernel object manipulation
• Kernel shellcode execution
• Hypervisor-level rootkits (for research)

THIS COURSE:
Module 14 covers kernel interaction fundamentals
```

**2. Hardware-Based Evasion**

```
EMERGING AREAS:
• CPU cache attacks (Spectre-like side channels)
• Hardware breakpoint abuse for stealthy execution
• DMA (Direct Memory Access) attacks
• Firmware implants (UEFI/BIOS level)

RELEVANCE:
Software-only evasion may not be enough soon.
Understanding hardware helps future-proof your skills.
```

**3. Quantum-Safe Cryptography in C2**

```
DRIVER:
Quantum computing threatens current encryption

IMPACT:
• Post-quantum algorithms for C2 channels
• Larger key sizes, different primitives
• Performance considerations

TIMING:
Not urgent yet, but starting to appear in requirements
```

**4. Zero-Trust Architecture Challenges**

```
DEFENSIVE TREND:
Organizations implementing Zero Trust (verify everything)

OFFENSIVE RESPONSE:
• Token theft becomes more valuable
• Living-off-the-land even more important
• Lateral movement gets harder
• Need to operate within assumed breach model

IMPLICATION:
Quality over quantity - each compromise must count
```

### **Skills That Will Always Matter**

Despite changing trends, core skills remain valuable:

```
TIMELESS SKILLS:
✓ Understanding operating system internals
✓ Assembly language and low-level concepts
✓ Network protocols and communication
✓ Cryptography fundamentals
✓ Software development best practices
✓ Reverse engineering ability
✓ Critical thinking and problem-solving

TRENDS MAY CHANGE, FUNDAMENTALS DON'T.
This course teaches you fundamentals using Go as the vehicle.
```

---

## **PRACTICAL EXERCISES**

Now that you understand the landscape, let's analyze existing tools hands-on:

### **Exercise 1: Framework Comparison Analysis**

**Objective**: Compare two major frameworks to understand design differences.

1. Metasploit Framework (Ruby/C)
2. Sliver (Go)

**Analysis Template**:

```
For each framework, document:

1. ARCHITECTURE
   • Language(s) used
   • Server/client architecture
   • Payload generation method
   • Communication protocols

2. IMPLANT CAPABILITIES
   • Process injection techniques available
   • Persistence mechanisms
   • Lateral movement features
   • Data exfiltration methods

3. OPERATIONAL SECURITY
   • Encryption (C2 traffic)
   • Jitter/sleep obfuscation
   • Traffic shaping capabilities
   • AV/EDR evasion features

4. EXTENSIBILITY
   • Plugin/module system
   • How easy to add new functionality
   • Community contributions

5. DETECTION PROFILE
   • How well-signatured?
   • Known IOCs (Indicators of Compromise)
   • Behavioral tells

6. USE CASE
   • Pentesting vs red teaming?
   • Strengths and weaknesses
```


**Documentation**

Create a comparison document:

```markdown
# Framework Comparison Analysis

## Metasploit Framework
**Architecture**: Ruby-based framework with C payloads
**Payload Size**: ~73KB (meterpreter/reverse_https)
**Strengths**:
- Extensive module library (2000+ exploits)
- Well-documented
- Active community

**Weaknesses**:
- Heavily signatured by AV/EDR
- Large payload sizes
- Obvious network traffic patterns

**Detection**: Windows Defender catches default payloads immediately

---

## Sliver
**Architecture**: Go-based C2 with compiled implants
**Payload Size**: ~12MB (default, can be reduced)
**Strengths**:
- Modern, actively developed
- Multiple C2 protocols
- Better evasion out-of-box

**Weaknesses**:
- Larger binary size (Go runtime)
- Younger project, smaller community

**Detection**: Lower detection rate than MSF, but still catchable

---

## Comparison Matrix
| Feature | Metasploit | Sliver | Cobalt Strike |
|---------|------------|--------|---------------|
| Payload Size | Small (~70KB) | Large (~12MB) | Medium (~200KB) |
| Languages | Ruby/C | Go | Java/C |
| Evasion | Poor | Good | Excellent (with tuning) |
| Cost | Free | Free | $5900/year |
| Use Case | Pentesting | Red Team | Red Team |
| Signatures | Many | Few | Growing |

## Conclusions
- Metasploit: Great for learning, poor for real operations
- Sliver: Solid choice for red teaming, good reference for this course
- Cobalt Strike: Industry standard, but expensive and increasingly signatured

This analysis demonstrates why custom tools are valuable - known
frameworks have known weaknesses.
```

### **Exercise 2: Malware Source Code Study (Educational)**

**Objective**: Study real malware source code to understand implementation techniques.

**IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER**:

- Study ONLY for educational purposes
- Never execute malware
- Use isolated VM environments
- Legal and ethical obligations apply

**Recommended Sources for Study**:

```
1. GITHUB REPOSITORIES (Public, educational malware samples)
   • theZoo (malware repository for researchers)
   • MalwareBazaar (malware samples database)
   • vx-underground (malware source code collection)

2. TECHNIQUES TO STUDY:
   • Process injection methods
   • API resolution (GetProcAddress alternatives)
   • String obfuscation
   • Persistence mechanisms
   • C2 communication protocols
```

**Sample Analysis Exercise**:

Find a simple backdoor written in C/C++ and answer:

```
ANALYSIS QUESTIONS:

1. API RESOLUTION
   • How does it locate Windows APIs?
   • Does it use GetProcAddress or manual resolution?
   • Are API names obfuscated?

2. PERSISTENCE
   • What persistence mechanism(s) used?
   • Registry keys? Scheduled tasks? Services?
   • How would you improve it?

3. COMMUNICATION
   • What protocol for C2? (HTTP, TCP, DNS?)
   • Is traffic encrypted?
   • What are the IOCs (Indicators of Compromise)?

4. EVASION
   • Any anti-debugging techniques?
   • VM detection?
   • String obfuscation?
   • How would you enhance evasion?

5. CODE QUALITY
   • Is the code well-written?
   • What would you do differently?
   • Any bugs or vulnerabilities in the malware itself?
```

**Example: Studying a Simple Backdoor**

```c
// Example snippet from educational malware sample
// DO NOT USE FOR MALICIOUS PURPOSES

// API Resolution via PEB walking
FARPROC GetProcAddressR(HMODULE hModule, LPCSTR lpProcName) {
    // Walk PEB to find kernel32.dll
    // Parse export table
    // Return function address
    // This technique evades static analysis
}

// Study Questions:
// 1. Why walk PEB instead of using GetModuleHandle?

### **Exercise 3: Tool Architecture Design**

**Objective**: Design your own offensive tool architecture before writing code.

**Scenario**: You're tasked with building a custom post-exploitation framework for long-term red team engagements. Design the architecture.

**Requirements**:
- Must evade modern EDR solutions
- Multi-operator support
- Encrypted C2 communication
- Modular capabilities
- Cross-platform (Windows primary, Linux secondary)

#### Custom C2 Framework Architecture Design

##### 1. COMPONENT OVERVIEW

###### Server Architecture
- Language: Go (cross-platform, good concurrency)
- Database: SQLite (embedded, simple)
- API: REST + WebSocket (real-time updates)
- Operators: Web UI (React/Vue) or CLI

###### Implant Architecture
- Language: Go (compiled, small, fast)
- Communication: HTTP/S + DNS (fallback)
- Encryption: ChaCha20 + AES
- Size Target: <5MB

##### 2. IMPLANT DESIGN

###### Core Capabilities
1. Process Injection (5 techniques)
2. Credential Harvesting
3. File Operations
4. Screenshot Capture
5. Keylogging
6. Network Scanning
7. Lateral Movement

###### Evasion Features
1. Direct syscalls (unhook NTDLL)
2. String obfuscation (XOR + RC4)
3. Sleep obfuscation (Ekko technique)
4. API hashing (custom algorithm)
5. Certificate pinning
6. Jitter (randomized callback intervals)

###### Communication Protocol
- Traffic Profile: HTTPS + DNS
- User-Agent: Randomized (Chrome/Firefox/Edge)
- TLS: Certificate pinning
- Timing: Jitter between 60-300 seconds
- Size: Variable (padding to avoid signatures)


###### Module System

Core Implant (minimal size)
├─ Module: Lateral Movement (load on demand)
├─ Module: Credential Dumping (load on demand)
├─ Module: Screenshot (load on demand)
└─ Module: Keylogger (load on demand)

Modules transmitted encrypted, loaded reflectively


##### 3. OPERATIONAL SECURITY

###### Server Infrastructure

[Operator] → [Login Server] → [Team Server] → [Redirector] → [Implant] (Authentication) (Control Logic) (Traffic Proxy)
- Redirectors: Disposable, easily replaced
- Team Server: Hidden, never directly exposed
- All traffic: Encrypted end-to-end


###### Persistence Strategy

- Primary: Scheduled Task (user context)
- Fallback: Registry Run Key
- Emergency: WMI Event Subscription
- All persistence: Encrypted payloads, environmental keying


##### 4. OPERATOR INTERFACE

###### Web UI Features
- Active implants dashboard
- Task queuing system
- File browser for compromised systems
- Credential manager
- Activity logs with search
- Collaboration features (chat, notes)

###### CLI Features
- Scriptable operations
- Automation support
- Quick commands for power users

##### 5. COMPARISON TO EXISTING TOOLS

| Feature | My Design | Metasploit | Sliver | Cobalt Strike |
|---------|-----------|------------|--------|---------------|
| Evasion | High | Low | Medium | High |
| Modularity | High | High | Medium | Medium |
| Multi-Op | Yes | Limited | Yes | Yes |
| Protocols | HTTP/S, DNS | Many | Many | HTTP/S, DNS, SMB |
| Cost | $0 (custom) | $0 | $0 | $5900/year |

##### 6. DEVELOPMENT PHASES

Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4): Core implant, basic C2
Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8): Evasion features, syscalls
Phase 3 (Weeks 9-12): Module system, operator UI
Phase 4 (Weeks 13-16): Testing, hardening, docs

##### 7. SUCCESS METRICS

✓ Evades Windows Defender (built-in)
✓ Evades Sophos/CrowdStrike (tested in lab)
✓ No crashes in 24-hour stress test
✓ Supports 100+ concurrent implants
✓ <1% packet loss in C2 communication
✓ Documentation complete for operators

##### LESSONS FROM THIS EXERCISE

This design exercise demonstrates:
• Architectural thinking before coding
• Trade-offs (simplicity vs features)
• Why certain design decisions matter
• How requirements drive implementation

Throughout this course, you'll build many components from this design.
The skills you learn enable you to turn designs like this into reality.
