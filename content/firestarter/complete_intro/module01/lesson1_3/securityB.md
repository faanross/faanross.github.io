## Understanding Windows Process Protection

Before we start, let's be clear about what Windows actually protects and how:




### Level 0: Your Own Processes
- **Protection:** None
- **Access Rights:** Full control (`PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS`)
- **Requirements:**  None (you own it)
- **Bypass:** None required

**Can Do:**
- Read/write memory
- Create threads
- Inject code
- Terminate
- Debug

**Examples:**
- `notepad.exe` you launched
- Your own applications etc


### Level 1: Other User's Processes (Same Privilege Level)
- **Protection:** User account separation (Security Descriptor)
- **Access Rights:** Blocked by ACL
- **Requirements:**  Administrator privileges OR same user account
- **Bypass:** Run as Administrator

**Can Do:**
- Read/write memory
- Create threads
- Inject code
- Terminate
- Debug

**Examples:**
- `notepad.exe` launched by another standard user







### Level 2: Regular System Services
- **Protection:** Runs as `SYSTEM` account (different security context)
- **Access Rights**: Blocked without `SeDebugPrivilege`

**Requirements:**
- Administrator privileges
- SeDebugPrivilege` ENABLED (not just available)


**OpenProcess Behavior:**
- Returns valid handle WITH `SeDebugPrivilege`
- Operations succeed (read/write/inject)

**Can Do (with SeDebugPrivilege):**
- Read/write memory
- Create threads
- Inject code
- Terminate
- Debug
- Full control

**Cannot Do:** Bypass PPL/PP protection (see Level 4/5)

**Examples:**
- `spoolsv.exe`
- most `svchost.exe` instances
- Windows services






```
Level 3: Critical System Processes
├─ Protection: 
│  • Runs as SYSTEM
│  • Critical Process flag (RtlSetProcessIsCritical)
├─ Access Rights: ACCESSIBLE with SeDebugPrivilege
├─ Requirements: Administrator + SeDebugPrivilege
├─ OpenProcess Behavior:
│  • Returns valid handle
│  • Operations SUCCEED (can read/write memory)
├─ Special Behavior: Terminating causes BSOD (Blue Screen of Death)
├─ Why Protected: System stability, not security
│  • These processes are essential for Windows to run
│  • Killing them crashes the entire OS
│  • Protection is about preventing accidental system crashes
├─ Can Do (with SeDebugPrivilege):


```



### Level 3: Critical System Processes
**Protection:**
- Runs as SYSTEM
- Critical Process flag (`RtlSetProcessIsCritical`)

- **Access Rights:** ACCESSIBLE with `SeDebugPrivilege`
- **Requirements:**  Administrator + `SeDebugPrivilege`

**OpenProcess Behavior:**
- Returns valid handle
- Operations SUCCEED (can read/write memory)

**Special Behaviour:** Terminating causes BSOD (Blue Screen of Death)

**Why Protected:**
- System stability, not security per se
- These processes are essential for Windows to run
- Killing them crashes the entire OS
- Protection is about preventing accidental system crashes

**Can Do (with SeDebugPrivilege):**
-  Read/write memory
- Create threads
- Inject code
- Debug
- Terminate (causes BSOD)


**Examples:**
- `csrss.exe` (Client/Server Runtime Subsystem)
- `smss.exe` (Session Manager Subsystem)
- `wininit.exe` (Windows Initialization Process)






### Level 4: Protected Process Light (PPL)

**Protection:**
- Kernel-enforced code signing requirements
- Memory protection via Process Security Token
- Kernel blocks unsigned code from accessing protected memory

**Access Rights:** SEVERELY RESTRICTED even with SeDebugPrivilege

**Requirements to Bypass:**
- Signed kernel driver with appropriate certificate, OR
- Kernel exploit, OR
- Physical DMA attack


**OpenProcess Behavior:**
- ⚠️ TRICKY!
- Returns valid handle (for compatibility)
- Handle is RESTRICTED (not full `PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS`)
- Operations FAIL at execution time (`ACCESS_DENIED`)



**Key Insights:**
- "Getting a handle ≠ Having access"
- Windows allows OpenProcess() to succeed
- Protection enforced when you TRY to use the handle
- This is "lazy enforcement" for backward compatibility


**Signing Requirements:**
- Requires specific code-signing certificates:
- Windows (Microsoft)
- Antimalware (registered AV vendors)
- WinTcb (Trusted Computing Base)
- LSA (Local Security Authority)


**Can Do:**
- Query basic info (PID, process name, exit code)
- Query limited information (PROCESS_QUERY_LIMITED_INFORMATION)

**Cannot Do (even with Admin + SeDebugPrivilege):**
- ❌ Read memory (ACCESS_DENIED)
- ❌ Write memory (ACCESS_DENIED)
- ❌ Create threads (ACCESS_DENIED)
- ❌ Inject code (ACCESS_DENIED)
- ❌ Debug (ACCESS_DENIED)



**Examples:**
- `lsass.exe` (Local Security Authority) - Windows 8.1+
- `MsMpEng.exe` (Windows Defender)
- `audiodg.exe` (Audio Device Graph Isolation)
- Antimalware services (most AV processes)



### Level 5: Protected Process (PP)
**Protection:**
- Full DRM-level protection (stronger than PPL)
- Kernel-enforced code signing with Microsoft signature
- Memory protection via Process Security Token (highest level)
- Stricter isolation from all non-PP processes

**Access Rights:** COMPLETELY BLOCKED even with SeDebugPrivilege

**Requirements to Bypass:**
- Signed kernel driver with Microsoft Windows signature, OR
- Kernel exploit, OR
- Physical DMA attack, OR
- Hardware debugger

**OpenProcess Behavior:**
- ⚠️ SAME TRICKY BEHAVIOUR AS PPL
- Returns valid handle (for compatibility)
- Handle is MAXIMALLY RESTRICTED
- ALL operations fail at execution time (ACCESS_DENIED)


**Key Differences from PPL:**
- Stricter signing requirements (Microsoft-only certificates)
- Protected from PPL processes (PPL cannot access PP)
- Used for high-security DRM and critical Windows components
- Cannot be debugged even by signed antimalware drivers

**Signing Requirements:**
- ONLY Microsoft Windows component signatures accepted
- Categories: Windows, WinTcb (Trusted Computing Base)
- Third-party signatures NOT accepted (unlike PPL)

**Can Do (even with Admin + SeDebugPrivilege):**
- Query basic info (PID, process name, exit code)
- Query limited information (PROCESS_QUERY_LIMITED_INFORMATION)

**Cannot Do (even with PPL-signed driver):**
- ❌ Read memory (ACCESS_DENIED)
- ❌ Write memory (ACCESS_DENIED)
- ❌ Create threads (ACCESS_DENIED)
- ❌ Inject code (ACCESS_DENIED)
- ❌ Debug (ACCESS_DENIED)
- ❌ Attach debuggers (ACCESS_DENIED)
- ❌ Access from PPL process (PP > PPL in hierarchy)
- ❌ Debug without Microsoft-signed driver

**Examples:**
- `services.exe` (Service Control Manager) - modern Windows
- Some DRM media processes (protected audio/video paths)
- Certain Windows Update components
- Credential Guard components (when enabled)



### Level 6: Kernel Mode (Ring 0)

**Protection:**
- Runs in privileged processor mode (Ring 0)
- PatchGuard (Kernel Patch Protection) - prevents kernel modifications
- Driver Signature Enforcement (DSE) - blocks unsigned drivers
- HVCI (Hypervisor-Protected Code Integrity) - optional, hardware-based
- Secure Boot - validates bootloader and kernel integrity
- Direct memory access to all user-mode processes

**Access Rights:** Not a "process" - this is the kernel itself


**Requirements to Access/Modify:**
- Signed kernel driver (WHQL certification), OR
- Boot-time kernel exploit, OR
- Physical access to disable Secure Boot, OR
- Hardware DMA attack (Thunderbolt, PCI Express), OR
- Hypervisor-level access (Ring -1)

**OpenProcess Behaviour:** N/A (not a user-mode process)

**PatchGuard (KPP):**
- Monitors critical kernel structures
- Detects unauthorized modifications
- Triggers BSOD if tampering detected (CRITICAL_STRUCTURE_CORRUPTION)
- Active on 64-bit Windows only
- Checks: IDT, GDT, System Service Tables, kernel code sections

**Driver Signature Enforcement (DSE):**
- Requires all drivers be digitally signed
- Validates signature against Microsoft's certificate chain
- Cannot be disabled on modern Windows (without boot options)
- Test mode required for unsigned drivers during development

**HVCI (Memory Integrity):**
- Uses hardware virtualization (VT-x/AMD-V)
- Runs kernel in a virtual machine
- Hypervisor validates all code pages before execution
- Prevents code injection even with kernel access
- Optional on Windows 10, default on Windows 11 (compatible hardware)

**What Kernel Mode Can Do:**
- Read/write ANY memory (including protected processes)
- Bypass PPL/PP protection completely
- Hook system calls
- Modify kernel structures
- Access hardware directly
- Disable security features (if PatchGuard bypassed)
- Install rootkits
- Complete system control


**What Even Kernel Mode CANNOT Do (with HVCI enabled):**
- ❌ Execute unsigned code pages
- ❌ Modify read-only kernel memory marked by hypervisor
- ❌ Bypass hypervisor-enforced policies

**Attack Surface:**
- Vulnerable kernel drivers (privilege escalation)
- Exploitable system calls
- Hardware vulnerabilities (Spectre, Meltdown)
- Supply chain attacks (compromised signed drivers)

**Examples:**
- `ntoskrnl.exe` (Windows NT Kernel)
- `hal.dll` (Hardware Abstraction Layer)
- `win32k.sys` (Win32 subsystem kernel component)
- All `.sys` drivers (graphics, network, storage, etc.)
- Antivirus kernel drivers
- Virtualization drivers (Hyper-V)





### BONUS Level 7: Hypervisor / Secure Kernel (Ring -1)
**Protection:**
- Runs at higher privilege than kernel (Ring -1)
- Isolated from main Windows kernel
- Enforces HVCI and Credential Guard
- Protected by hardware virtualization (VT-x/AMD-V)
- Validates all kernel code execution

**Access Rights:** Not directly accessible

**Requirements to Compromise:**
- Hardware vulnerability (CPU, chipset)
- Hypervisor exploit (extremely rare)
- Physical access to firmware
- Supply chain attack on hardware/firmware


**What It Protects:**
- Isolated security processes (VTL 1 - Virtual Trust Level 1)
- Credential Guard (`lsaiso.exe` runs here)
- Device Guard / Application Control policies
- Kernel memory integrity

**Examples:**
- Hyper-V Hypervisor (`hvix64.exe`, `hvax64.exe`)
- Secure Kernel (`securekernel.exe`)
- `lsaiso.exe` (Credential Guard - isolated lsass)
- Virtualization-Based Security (VBS) components

**Note:** Only present on systems with VBS/HVCI enabled
