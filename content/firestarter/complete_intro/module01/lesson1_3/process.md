# **LESSON 1.3: WINDOWS INTERNALS REVIEW FOR OFFENSIVE OPERATIONS**

---

## **Understanding Your Battlefield**

You've chosen Go as your weapon. You understand the offensive tooling landscape and the language trade-offs. Now you must master your battlefield: **Windows**.

Every offensive technique you'll learn - process injection, privilege escalation, evasion, persistence - requires deep understanding of Windows internals. You can't manipulate what you don't understand. You can't evade detection if you don't know what defenders monitor. You can't exploit a system whose architecture is a mystery.

This lesson isn't about memorizing facts. It's about building a **mental model** of how Windows actually works under the hood - the architecture that Microsoft's documentation glosses over, the internal structures that offensive developers exploit, the mechanisms that both enable and constrain your operations.

By the end of this lesson, you will:

- **Understand process architecture** at a level that enables injection techniques
- **Navigate memory management** including virtual memory, VAD trees, and protections
- **Comprehend the security model** - tokens, privileges, integrity levels, and their exploitation
- **Parse PE file structures** to manipulate executables in memory
- **Abuse PEB/TEB structures** for evasion and information gathering
- **Recognize what defenders monitor** and how to operate beneath their sensors

This is foundational knowledge. Every subsequent module builds on these concepts. Let's begin.
