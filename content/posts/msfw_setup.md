# description
this is the first episode in a series where we'll be learning the basics of command and control (C2) by using metasploit. 

in this video we'll:
- create a meterpreter handler/listener
- use msfvenom to generate a payload
- run the payload on the victim's system
- establish a c2 connection (reverse meterpreter shell) as a result
