title: "Introduction to Phishing & Payload Delivery"
type: "page"
---

This lesson represents the bridge between reconnaissance and gaining actual access to a target environment. As defenders and threat hunters, we must  understand how attackers weaponize seemingly innocuous files and communications to compromise systems.

**Why This Matters:** According to industry reports, over 90% of successful breaches begin with phishing. Understanding the attacker's methodology - from crafting malicious documents to evading detection - is essential for building effective hunting hypotheses and detection strategies.

**Learning Objectives:** By the end of this lesson, you will understand:

- The complete anatomy of a phishing attack chain
- Multiple document weaponization techniques and their underlying mechanisms
- Various payload delivery methods and their trade-offs
- The difference between stagers and staged payloads
- How attackers evade detection at each stage
- Tools attackers use to create and deliver payloads
