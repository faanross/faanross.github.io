## Introduction - A Historical Perspective

The intersection of artificial intelligence and offensive security represents one of the most transformative developments in cybersecurity history. To understand where we are today - and more importantly, where we're headed - we must first trace the evolutionary path that brought us to the age of autonomous offensive agents.

This convergence didn't happen overnight. It emerged through decades of incremental innovation, each building upon the last, until we reached a critical inflection point where AI systems became sophisticated enough to independently conduct security operations that once required teams of human experts.
