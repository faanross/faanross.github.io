## The Dawn of Digital Security Assessment

In the 1990s and early 2000s, **penetration testing** was less a defined methodology and more an artisanal craft. Security professionals operated as digital detectives, manually investigating systems with the same thoroughness a detective might examine a crime scene. There were no comprehensive frameworks, no automated scanners running continuously in the background - just skilled individuals, basic tools, and an enormous amount of time.

This era established the foundational techniques that all subsequent automation would build upon. The **manual pentester**needed to understand not just what vulnerabilities existed, but how to recognize them through observation, intuition, and methodical investigation.
