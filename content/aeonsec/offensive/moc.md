## Master-Level Course: Autonomous Offensive Security Agents (AI Red Teaming)

---

## Course Description

This comprehensive, zero-to-hero postgraduate program transforms students from foundational understanding to advanced practitioners capable of developing, deploying, and optimizing autonomous AI agents for offensive security operations. Unlike traditional red teaming courses or AI security courses focused on defending against AI threats, this curriculum uniquely focuses on **leveraging agentic AI systems to conduct sophisticated penetration testing and security assessments**.

Students will master the complete technology stack—from low-level machine learning fundamentals through advanced multi-agent orchestration—culminating in the ability to architect autonomous systems that can execute complex offensive security operations across all 14 MITRE ATT&CK tactics. The course emphasizes both theoretical mastery and practical implementation, ensuring graduates can not only deploy existing tools but also innovate new capabilities by understanding research papers and implementing cutting-edge techniques from first principles.

## Learning Outcomes

By course completion, students will be able to:

1. Design and implement custom AI agents from scratch for offensive security operations
2. Train specialized models for security-specific tasks (vulnerability detection, exploit generation, lateral movement)
3. Architect multi-agent systems that collaborate to achieve complex penetration testing objectives
4. Recreate state-of-the-art offensive AI research (Dreadnode, Mindgard, academic papers)
5. Deploy agents across all 14 MITRE ATT&CK tactics autonomously
6. Build and maintain isolated offensive AI testing environments
7. Optimize agent performance for stealth, efficiency, and goal achievement
8. Integrate custom tooling, APIs, and frameworks into agent workflows
9. Understand ethical implications and responsible disclosure practices
