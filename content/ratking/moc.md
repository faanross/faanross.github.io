## Post-exploitation Malware Development Course
- In this multi-part course we'll create Remote Access Trojan (RAT) in C# based on a gRPC model with ASP.NET (backend) and Blazor (frontend). 
- We'll create it with a plug-and-play architecture (inspired by Mythic C2) to leverage microservices + optimize for a modular/extensible design. 
- In the end you'll have created a fully functioning RAT with a Windows-based server, web-based UI, cross-platform client, ability to record connection details, perform host and process enumeration, as well as spawn an interactive shell on target.
- **PLEASE NOTE**: This course is taught in-person by me along with AntiSyphon Training, however the entire course is available on this page for free in written format.
