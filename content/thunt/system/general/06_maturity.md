# The Threat Hunting Maturity Model

## The Maturity Question

One of the most common questions organizations ask when considering threat hunting is simply: "Are we ready?"

This is a deceptively [complex question](https://www.threathunting.net/files/framework-for-threat-hunting-whitepaper.pdf). You might have a skilled security team, significant budget, and executive support - but still not be ready for effective threat hunting. Conversely, a smaller organization with the right foundational capabilities might be better positioned to succeed than a larger one with impressive but poorly integrated security tools.

The challenge is that "readiness" isn't binary. Organizations don't transition overnight from "not ready" to "ready for hunting." Instead, hunting capabilities develop along a maturity continuum, with each level building on capabilities established at previous levels. Trying to skip levels - attempting sophisticated hunting without foundational capabilities - almost always fails, wasting resources and creating frustration that can poison future security initiatives.

This is where maturity models become invaluable. A good maturity model helps you honestly assess where you are, understand what capabilities you need to develop next, and chart a realistic path toward more sophisticated hunting. It prevents premature investments in capabilities you're not ready to use effectively, and it provides clear milestones to demonstrate progress to leadership.



## Understanding the Model

The [Hunting Maturity Model](http://detect-respond.blogspot.com/2015/10/a-simple-hunting-maturity-model.html), originally developed by Sqrrl and later refined by the broader security community, describes five maturity levels ranging from HMM0 (initial/ad-hoc) through HMM4 (leading practice). Each level represents progressively more sophisticated capabilities, better integration with other security functions, and greater organizational impact.

INITIAL             • No hunting capability
                    • Purely reactive security
                    • Minimal logging
                    • Alert-driven only
```


The model is descriptive, not prescriptive - it describes what characterizes each level without mandating a single path for advancement. Organizations should focus on building genuine capabilities rather than "checking boxes" to claim a particular maturity level.

Importantly, higher maturity isn't always better in absolute terms. A mature hunting program at HMM3 or HMM4 requires significant ongoing investment in people, tools, and processes. Some organizations are better served by a solid HMM2 capability that's well-maintained and integrated rather than stretching resources to achieve HMM4. The goal is appropriate maturity for your organization's risk profile, resources, and threat landscape - not maximum maturity regardless of context.



## The Journey Through Maturity Levels

### HMM0: Starting Out

Organizations at HMM0 have no threat hunting capability. Security operations are purely reactive, responding to alerts generated by automated systems. When asked "How do you hunt for threats?" the honest answer is "We don't - we respond to alerts."

This doesn't mean these organizations have no security program. They may have firewalls, antivirus, SIEM systems, and dedicated security staff. But their operational model is fundamentally reactive: wait for alerts, investigate alerts, respond to confirmed incidents. There's no proactive searching for threats that haven't triggered alerts.

The primary challenge at HMM0 is typically insufficient data collection. Logging is minimal, often limited to what's required for compliance. Critical data sources like detailed endpoint telemetry or comprehensive authentication logs may not exist. Even more fundamentally, SOC analysts spend all their time triaging alerts - there's simply no capacity for proactive investigation.

Many organizations stay at HMM0 not because they're unaware of threat hunting but because they face legitimate constraints. Small security teams handling high alert volumes have no spare capacity for proactive hunting. Legacy systems, insufficient logging, and fragmented tools create an environment where hunting would be technically infeasible even if personnel had time.

The path forward from HMM0 focuses on foundational capabilities rather than jumping directly to hunting. Organizations must improve data collection by expanding logging to include critical security data sources and deploying EDR tools that provide detailed telemetry. Equally important is optimizing SOC operations to reduce alert volume through better tuning, creating capacity for proactive activities. Without understanding what "normal" looks like in your environment, hunting for "abnormal" becomes impossible - making baseline documentation essential.

### HMM1: The First Hunting Steps

At HMM1, organizations begin attempting threat hunting, but in an ad-hoc, crisis-driven manner. Hunting happens sporadically - usually after incidents or when specific intelligence suggests particular threats - rather than as regular operational activity. This might look like a senior analyst investigating unusual authentication patterns after hearing about a credential stuffing campaign, or exploring network traffic after reading about a new malware family.

The key difference from HMM0 is intentionality. Someone deliberately searches for threats rather than waiting for alerts. However, this hunting is inconsistent, undocumented, and individual-driven. Knowledge gained during hunts rarely transfers to the broader team, and there's no systematic tracking of what's been investigated or what requires investigation.

The transition from HMM1 to HMM2 centers on making hunting regular and repeatable. This requires dedicating specific resources to hunting - even if it's just a few hours per week from existing analysts - and establishing a predictable hunting schedule. Organizations begin documenting their hunts, capturing what was investigated, what techniques were used, and what was discovered. Simple knowledge management practices emerge, ensuring insights from one hunt inform future investigations.




### HMM2: Establishing Regularity

HMM2 represents the first level where hunting becomes a sustained operational capability rather than an occasional activity. The defining characteristic is regularity: hunting happens on a predictable schedule with designated resources. This might be a security analyst spending 20% of their time on hunting, or a rotation where team members dedicate specific weeks to hunting activities.

Data collection at HMM2 becomes more comprehensive and purposeful. Organizations have identified what data sources are most valuable for hunting and have implemented collection strategies to ensure this data is available, retained, and accessible. There's conscious thought about what log sources support hunting versus compliance requirements.

However, HMM2 hunting remains relatively informal. Procedures exist but are basic and inconsistent. Different hunters might approach similar questions differently, and there's limited structure to ensure comprehensive coverage. Success depends heavily on individual hunter skill and motivation rather than organizational processes.

The challenge at this level is typically integration. Hunting exists as an activity but isn't deeply integrated with SOC operations, incident response, or threat intelligence functions. Findings from hunts may not systematically feed back into detection engineering. Threat intelligence might inform some hunts but not in a structured way. The hunting function operates somewhat in isolation.



### HMM3: Systematization and Integration

HMM3 represents mature, procedural hunting where the practice is formalized, systematized, and deeply integrated with other security functions. The transition from HMM2 to HMM3 typically involves establishing a dedicated hunting capability with formal procedures, documented playbooks, and quality assurance mechanisms.

At HMM3, hunting has a defined workflow. There are documented procedures for how hunts are initiated, conducted, documented, and concluded. Playbooks guide hunters through investigating specific threat scenarios. Coverage is tracked to ensure critical assets and attack surfaces are regularly examined. Hunting effectiveness is measured and reported to leadership.

Integration becomes a defining feature. Hunting feeds detections back to Detection Engineers: patterns discovered during hunts become automated alerts. Established protocols informs hunt prioritization. Incident response leverages hunting techniques during investigations. Overall organizational security posture benefits from hunt findings. The hunting function is no longer isolated but serves as a sort of defensive glue, serving to connect multiple security capabilities.

Organizations at HMM3 have typically solved the sustainability problem. Hunting isn't dependent on individual heroes but operates as a sustainable business function with documented processes, adequate resources, and management support.


### HMM4: Industry Leadership

HMM4 represents the cutting edge - organizations that don't just practice hunting but advance the discipline. They develop novel hunting techniques, create sophisticated automation, produce original threat intelligence, and often contribute to the broader security community through publications, tool releases, and conference presentations.

At this level, hunting incorporates advanced analytics that may involve the use of machine learning. Automation assists hunters by identifying anomalies or patterns worth investigating, but human hunters remain essential for hypothesis generation and contextual analysis. The organization often creates custom tools and techniques tailored to their specific environment and threat landscape.

HMM4 organizations are relatively rare and typically include mature security programs at large enterprises, sophisticated managed security service providers, or security vendors. The investment required to reach and sustain HMM4 is substantial, and many organizations are better served by excellence at HMM3 than stretching to achieve HMM4.

## Common Pitfalls in Maturity Advancement

The most common mistake organizations make is attempting to skip maturity levels. Leadership, excited by the promise of threat hunting, wants immediate results. They hire experienced hunters, purchase sophisticated platforms, and expect transformative security improvements. But without foundational capabilities - comprehensive data collection, optimized SOC operations, baseline understanding - even skilled hunters struggle to produce value.



Another frequent error is the "checkbox mentality" - claiming maturity based on superficial indicators. An organization might claim HMM2 because they conduct occasional hunts, ignoring that these hunts are inconsistent, undocumented, and produce minimal operational value. True maturity comes from capabilities that deliver consistent value, not from activities that technically qualify as hunting.

Organizations also sometimes believe that purchasing sophisticated tools advances maturity. They buy hunting platforms marketed for "HMM3-4 capabilities" while their actual operations remain HMM1. Tools enable capabilities but don't create them. People, processes, and foundational data must be in place before tools provide value.

## Charting Your Path Forward

Honestly assessing your organization's current maturity starts with asking the right questions at each boundary:
- **Between HMM0 and HMM**1: Do we conduct any proactive threat hunting, or only respond to alerts? Do we have sufficient data collection to support hunting if we wanted to?
- **Between HMM1 and HMM2**: Do we hunt regularly or only sporadically? Are hunting activities documented and knowledge shared?
- **Between HMM2 and HMM3**: Do we have formal hunting procedures and playbooks? Is there a dedicated hunting function?
- **Between HMM3 and HMM3**: Do we have the resources, knowledge, and business need to drive innovation in the industry as a whole?


Your current maturity is the highest level where you can honestly answer "yes" to these questions. This assessment enables realistic planning for advancement - a multi-year roadmap identifying where you are now, where you want to be, and what capabilities need development in what sequence.

The key principle throughout this journey is prioritizing foundations over advanced features. Better to have solid HMM2 capability than shakily-implemented HMM3 procedures built on inadequate foundations. Maturity advancement is gradual, and celebrating intermediate achievements - completing your first documented hunt, establishing regular hunting cadence, creating your first hunting playbook - helps maintain momentum through what can be a years-long journey.

Most importantly, remember that higher maturity doesn't always mean more value. Early maturity advancement (HMM0→1→2) often produces dramatic value improvements. Later advancement (HMM3→4) produces incremental improvements that may or may not justify the investment depending on context. The goal is matching maturity to need - pursuing the level that provides optimal security value given your threat landscape, resources, and organizational context, not simply achieving the highest number.

The Hunting Maturity Model provides a roadmap, but each organization's journey is unique. The question isn't "What maturity level should we achieve?" but rather "What capabilities do we need to address our threats effectively?" Answer that question honestly, and the right maturity target becomes clear.
