## Reconnaissance: The Intelligence Gathering Phase

Reconnaissance represents the adversary's information gathering activities before they even touch your infrastructure. They're scanning your public presence, crawling your website, researching employees on LinkedIn, and mapping your external attack surface.

**Threat Hunting Reality**: This is largely outside our hunting domain. These activities happen beyond our visibility perimeter, in public data sources and external infrastructure we don't control. While security awareness and external attack surface management are crucial, there's minimal internal telemetry to hunt through.

Our focus here is typically defensive: reducing our public footprint, monitoring for data leaks, and ensuring we're not making an adversary's reconnaissance easier than necessary.
