Welcome to the first lesson of your machine learning journey. Before we dive into building models and hunting threats, we need to understand where we came from. Artificial Intelligence didn't emerge fully-formed - it's the result of decades of ambitious dreams, crushing failures, and unexpected breakthroughs. Understanding this evolution will help you appreciate why modern ML works the way it does, why certain approaches dominate, and what limitations we're still working to overcome.

This lesson traces the arc from symbolic AI to today's deep learning revolution, showing how each era's failures informed the next generation's successes. By the end, you'll understand why we use neural networks instead of rule-based systems, why "deep learning" is different from earlier machine learning, and how the field's history shapes the tools you'll use for threat hunting.
