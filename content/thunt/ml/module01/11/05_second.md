## The Collapse of the LISP Machine Market

The 1980s AI boom was built on specialized LISP machine computers, optimized for symbolic processing. But when general-purpose workstations (Sun, IBM) became powerful enough to run AI software, the expensive LISP machine market collapsed. Companies like Symbolics went bankrupt.

This hardware collapse coincided with expert systems' limitations becoming clear. The result? **The Second AI Winter**. Funding evaporated. The term "artificial intelligence" became toxic - researchers began calling their work "informatics," "knowledge systems," or "machine learning" instead.

## The Silver Lining: Quiet Progress

While the AI hype cycle crashed, serious researchers made crucial progress:

**1. Backpropagation Rediscovered (1986):** David Rumelhart, Geoffrey Hinton, and Ronald Williams popularized backpropagation, an algorithm for training multi-layer neural networks. This solved the problem Minsky and Papert had highlighted - you _could_ train deeper networks to learn complex functions like XOR.

**2. Statistical Methods Emerge:** Machine learning began emphasizing statistical approaches over symbolic logic. Rather than encoding knowledge as rules, why not learn patterns from data?

**3. Support Vector Machines (1992):** Vladimir Vapnik and colleagues developed SVMs, which used clever mathematics (kernel methods) to find optimal decision boundaries in data. These became the go-to method for classification tasks.
