## Introduction

Welcome to your first hands-on journey with Elasticsearch! In this module, you'll transform from theory to practice, getting your hands dirty with the core building blocks of the Elastic Stack. Think of this as building the foundation of your threat hunting fortress - every concept you master here will be essential for the advanced techniques you'll learn later.

By the end of this module, you'll have a fully functional Elasticsearch instance, understand how to interact with it through REST APIs, create and manage indices, define data mappings, and execute queries that will later help you hunt for threats in your environment.

## Prerequisites

Before diving in, ensure you have:

- A dedicated server or VM (bare metal preferred) with:
    - **OS**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or similar Linux distribution
    - **RAM**: Minimum 8GB, 16GB recommended
    - **CPU**: 4+ cores recommended
    - **Disk**: 200GB+ available storage
    - **Network**: Stable internet connection for downloads
- Root or sudo access
- Basic Linux command-line familiarity
- curl installed (usually pre-installed on Linux)
